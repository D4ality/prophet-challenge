# prophet-challenge
Assignment workflow is still in session. Had software readability issues that had to be troubleshooted with a professional. Family and work matters for the week were taken in consideration including vehicle maintenance. I will do my best to ensure proper delivery of the materials being researched. I am also aware about the resubmission protocols. Greatly apologize for the delay and hope this does not count as a failure to adhere to standards.
I am still in the learning phase of obtaining better knowledge of my coding skills.
